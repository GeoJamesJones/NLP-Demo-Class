<P>BAGHDAD &#8212; Twin car bombings killed 13 people Thursday in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood, and Iraq prepared to execute two of Saddam Hussein's co-defendants despite an appeal from the United Nations.</P>
<P>The explosions went off one after the other at 10:30 a.m. in the Mansour neighborhood, setting fire to a gas station and incinerating at least a half-dozen cars. At least 25 people were wounded, police said.</P>
<P>Firefighters sprayed water on the wreckage as soldiers and civilians staggered around in a daze. Blood pooled among scattered containers for propane and kerosene, near where tea cups lay toppled on a blanket spread over wood crates.</P>
<P>Mansour is a primarily Sunni neighborhood in western Baghdad. During Saddam's regime, it was home to the most elite Iraqi families; many international embassies remain there, though shuttered.</P>
<P>U.S. Maj. Gen. William Caldwell said this week there had been a "downturn" in violence during the four-day Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which began last weekend. Thursday was the first day after Eid for both Sunnis and Shiites. Caldwell acknowledged the possibility that violence could surge again.</P>
<P>Police said 47 tortured bodies were found dumped across Baghdad on Thursday, up from 27 a day earlier. An American soldier was killed by small-arms fire in western Baghdad, the military said.</P>
<P>Iraqi officials said Thursday they planned to execute two of Saddam's co-defendants in the coming days. The former Iraqi dictator was hanged Saturday.</P>
<P>U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour appealed to Iraq not to execute Barzan Ibrahim, Saddam's half brother and former intelligence chief, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, former head of the Revolutionary Court. Saddam and the two men were sentenced to death for the killing of 148 Shiites in the 1980s.</P>
<P>"Nobody can stop the carrying out of court verdicts," Sami al-Askari, an adviser to the prime minister, told the BBC's Arabic service. "The court's statute does not allow even the president of the republic or the prime minister to commute sentences, let alone grant a pardon. Therefore, no pressure can stop the executions."</P>
<P>In Washington, lawyers for al-Bandar filed a new request for the U.S. Supreme Court to block his transfer from U.S. to Iraqi custody.</P>
<P>In the southern city of Basra on Thursday, more than 1,500 people demonstrated to express approval of Saddam's execution. The peaceful rally began at the offices of the Dawa Party and ended at the provincial governor's building. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who pushed for a speedy execution of Saddam, is a leader of the party.</P>
