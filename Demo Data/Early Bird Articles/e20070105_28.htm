<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>Report: US Sees Signs Of Nuclear Test</P></FONT></B></P>
<P>North Korea appears to have made preparations for another nuclear test, ABC News reported last night, citing US defense officials. "We think they've put everything in place to conduct a test without any notice or warning," ABC quoted a senior US defense official as saying. The official cautioned that the intelligence is inconclusive on whether North Korea will go ahead with another test, but said the preparations are similar to steps taken by Pyongyang before it conducted its first nuclear test on Oct. 9.</P>
