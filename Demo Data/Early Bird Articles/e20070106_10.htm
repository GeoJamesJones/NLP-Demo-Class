<P>By Solomon Moore, Times Staff Writer</P>
<p>BAGHDAD &#8212; A U.S. civilian contractor and two Iraqi interpreters were kidnapped Friday near the southern city of Basra, Iraqi police officials said.</p>

<p>Police Col. Kareem Azaidi in Basra said witnesses saw gunmen in a civilian car, a pickup and two police vehicles cut off the captives' car and take them hostage.</p>

<p>U.S. Embassy spokesman Lou Fintor declined to identify the victims. "We're aware of reports that an American citizen was kidnapped," he said. "And we're looking into them."</p>

<p>The fate of the American contractor was unknown, but the two Iraqis were later found dead, the Associated Press reported.</p>

<p>The abductions came a day after a videotape emerged showing four kidnapped Americans and an Austrian.</p>

<p>The five men in the video said they were contractors for Crescent Security Group, a Kuwait-based firm, abducted near Basra in November. The men identified themselves as John R. Young, 44, of Kansas City, Mo.; Jon Cote of Buffalo, N.Y.; Josh Munns, 23, of Redding, Calif.; Paul Johnson Reuben of Buffalo, Minn.; and Bert Nussbaumer of Austria.</p>

<p>"I'm well; my friends are well. We've been treated well," Young said. Reuben said the video was recorded Dec. 22.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the first Friday prayers since Saddam Hussein was hanged, Shiite Muslim clerics called the death of the former Iraqi president &#8212; whose regime favored minority Sunnis &#8212; a "breakthrough" and condemned those who opposed the recording of the execution.</p>

<p>"The execution of Saddam is a turning point not only in the history of the Iraqi people but in the whole area," Shiite cleric Sadruddin Qubanchi said in the holy city of Najaf. "We foresee a new breakthrough in the region, and this explains the anger of some Arab countries&#8230;. Libya, Algeria and Yemen &#8212; all these governments are tyrannical too."</p>

<p>Sunni Arabs throughout the Middle East complained about the way Hussein was executed. A cellphone camera recorded supporters of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr taunting and jeering Hussein as he stood on the gallows.</p>

<p>Qubanchi accused the critics of hypocrisy. "When Saudi Arabia shot dead in the streets 400 Iranian Shiite pilgrims after they held a demonstration, no one protested," he said. "But today those who pretend to grieve over Saddam are really grieving only because they fear the wind of change will move people in their countries."</p>

<p>At Baghdad's Bratha Mosque, Sheik Jalaluddin Saghir, a Shiite cleric and parliament member, said that whatever pain Hussein experienced paled in comparison to the atrocities he committed.</p>

<p>"Executing Saddam on the first day of Eid made the Baathists and Sunnis angry," Saghir said, referring to the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha. "That is all pretense. Saddam used to execute leaders and prominent figures anytime he liked &#8212; even during Eid."</p>

<p>Sheik Harith Obeidi, a prominent Sunni cleric and parliament member, avoided discussing Hussein's execution and focused instead on religious matters.</p>

<p>Many sermons emphasized the failure of the government to provide security and services.</p>

<p>At least 18 bodies were discovered Friday in Baghdad, some with gunshots to the head and wounds suggesting torture.</p>

<p>Mortar fire killed at least 10 other Iraqis in the capital, and at least five people, including a police officer, were shot to death.</p>

<p>Police officials said 30 gunmen drove 18 Shiite families out of their west Baghdad homes.</p>
