<p>Senior U.S. officials yesterday expressed unease with the Iraq government's handling of the execution of Saddam Hussein, as officials in Baghdad made final preparations to hang two of the former dictator's closest aides.</p>

<p>State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said U.S. officials raised concerns last week about the timing of Saturday's execution, held on the first day of a major Sunni Muslim holiday, and whether it conformed to Iraq's own legal processes.</p>

<p>In Baghdad, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell, spokesman for the U.S. military, also questioned the raucous final moments of Saddam's execution. An unauthorized cell-phone camera recording, widely shown on Arab-language television, shows Saddam being heckled and insulted by Shi'ite Muslims in the crowd as the noose is being placed around his neck.</p>

<p>"If you are asking me, 'Would we have done things differently?' -- yes, we would have," Gen. Caldwell said in a briefing. "But that's not our decision. That's the decision of Iraq's government."</p>

<p>Iraqi authorities reported the arrests yesterday of two guards and an official who supervised Saddam's hanging and said the guard force was infiltrated by outsiders who taunted the former leader and shot the video showing his body dangling at the end of a rope.</p>

<p>Iraqi officials also said they plan to proceed as early as today with the execution of two of Saddam's closest aides and co-defendants -- former intelligence chief Barzan Ibrahim, Saddam's half brother, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court.</p>

<p>The two were originally sentenced to die alongside Saddam for their role in the 1982 killings of 148 Shi'ite Muslims after a failed assassination attempt against Saddam, but their execution was delayed so Saddam could be "executed on a special day," said Moffawak al-Rubaie, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's national security adviser.</p>

<p>Both Gen. Caldwell and Mr. McCormack said no U.S. officials were present at Saddam's hanging or had any say on Saddam's treatment after he was transferred to Iraqi control shortly before his death.</p>

<p>Gen. Caldwell said Saddam thanked his American jailers for the way they treated him as they sent him to his death.</p>

<p>"Saddam ... was dignified, as always, he was courteous as he always had been to his U.S. military police guards," he told reporters in Baghdad.</p>

<p>Mr. McCormack noted that the al-Maliki government has expressed unhappiness with the manner in which the execution was carried out, ordering an investigation to determine who shot the cell-phone video that was quickly leaked to the press.</p>

<p>"It wasn't supposed to have happened, but it happened and the Iraqi government is launching an investigation into it," the State Department spokesman said.</p>

<p>Sunni Muslims have staged protests in the wake of Saddam's death, but Gen. Caldwell said there has been no spike in violence since the hanging, which occurred on the first day of a major Islamic religious holiday that ended yesterday.</p>

<p>In New York, U.N. officials stepped up their criticism of the Iraqi trials that produced the death sentences, appealing to Baghdad to postpone the executions of Saddam's two co-conspirators.</p>

<p>Louise Arbour, the world body's top human rights official, and Philip Alston, the U.N. special rapporteur on capital punishment, cited concerns about the conduct of Saddam's trial, the hasty appeals process and the unruly final moments of the dictator's life.</p>

<p>Mr. Alston, a law professor at New York University, said, "The Iraqi government engaged in an unseemly and evidently politically motivated effort to expedite the execution by denying time for a meaningful appeal and by closing off every avenue to review the punishment."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arbour appealed directly to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to block the planned executions, saying international law gave both condemned men the right to seek commutation of their sentences or to ask for a pardon.</p>

<p>White House spokesman Tony Snow said President Bush had not seen the footage of Saddam's execution. The president was far more focused on fashioning a new strategy for winning the war in Iraq, Mr. Snow said.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Snow and Mr. McCormack rejected criticisms of the Iraqi trial that led to Saturday's execution, saying Saddam was given a much fairer day in court than the vast number of Iraqis who died at the hands of his regime.</p>

<p>"At the end of the day, justice was served to Saddam Hussein," Mr. McCormack said.</p>
