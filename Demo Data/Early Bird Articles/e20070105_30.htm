<P>What early risers in Colorado and Wyoming thought was a fiery pre-dawn meteor shower was actually the breakup of a Russian-made rocket that launched a French telescope into orbit last week, U.S. aerospace officials said. At least one hunk of the Soyuz-2-1B rocket landed outside Riverton, Wyo., after a fiery re-entry, police Capt. Mark Stone said. Of the 213 rockets, old satellites and other debris that dropped from orbit in 2006, only one landed on U.S. soil, says Lt. Cmdr. Sean Kelly of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which had tracked the rocket since its Dec. 27 launch.</P>
