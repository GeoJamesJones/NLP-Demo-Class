<P>An article yesterday about a guilty plea by Army Specialist Juston R. Graber in connection with the deaths of three Iraqi men misstated the charge against him and the maximum punishment three other soldiers could receive if convicted. Specialist Graber was charged with noncapital murder, not capital murder, and the three other soldiers scheduled for courts martial face life in prison &#8212; not the death penalty &#8212; if convicted.</P>
