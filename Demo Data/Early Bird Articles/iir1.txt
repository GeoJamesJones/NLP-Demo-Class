TEXT:  1.                                FROM 960511 TO 960520,
UNITED NATIONS SPECIAL COMMISSION (UNSCOM) ONGOING
MONITORING AND VERIFICATION SUPPORT TEAM-NINE B (OST-9B)
INSPECTED THE FOLLOWING IRAQI CHEMICAL WARFARE (CW)
RELATED FACILITIES--FALLUJAH THREE FacilityID 123 CASTOR OIL EXTRACTION
FACILITY//GEOCOORD:  333288N0433694E//, THE KHAMISIYAH
(TALL AL-LAHM) AMMUNITION STORAGE AREA//GEOCOORD:
3047N04626E//, AND THE AN-NASIRIYAH STORAGE
DEPOT//GEOCOORD:  3057N04606E//.

(b.1. sec. 1.5.c.)



3.                                              KHAMISIYAH (TALL AL-LAHM)
AMMUNITION STORAGE AREA.  OST-9B INSPECTED THE AREA INSIDE
AND AROUND BUNKER 73.  THIS STRUCTURE WAS TOTALLY
DESTROYED, BUT THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF
SAKR-18, 122MM CHEMICAL ROCKETS BOTH IN THE PREVIOUS
FOOTPRINT OF THE STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS THE SURROUNDING
AREA.  THE INSPECTION TEAM TOOK A NUMBER OF STILL AND
VIDEO PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE AREA AND THE ROCKETS,
CONCENTRATING ON FEATURES WHICH ARE SPECIFIC TO CW FILLED
ROCKETS (I.E. CENTRAL BURSTER, PLASTIC CANISTERS, ETC.).  (b.1. sec. 1.5. c.)
  DISCUSSIONBETWEEN THE INSPECTION TEAM AND THE IRAQI REPRESENTATIVES
REVEALED THE FOLLOWING--
3A.                                     IRAQ MOVED 2,160 SAKR-18 GB/GF
FILLED ROCKETS (TWO CANISTERS-GA/GF) BETWEEN 910110 TO
910115 FROM AL-MUTHANNA STATE ESTABLISHMENT//GEOCOORD:
335031N0435051E// TO BUNKER 73.  (FIELD COMMENT--GA IS
TABUN, GB IS SARIN, AND GF IS CYCLOHEXYL SARIN.)
3B.                                   ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, THE ROCKETS
BEGAN TO LEAK AND THE IRAQIS BEGAN TO MANUALLY MOVE THE
ROCKETS (FOUR MEN PER ROCKET) TO A SITE, IN THE OPEN, NEAR
THE CANAL, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY FOUR KILOMETERS FROM
BUNKER 73.  BY THE TIME OF THE IRAQI RETREAT IN LATE
910200 AND EARLY 910300, APPROXIMATELY 1,100 ROCKETS HAD
BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SITE.  BOTH BUNKER 73 AND THE
ROCKETS THAT WERE STORED IN THE OPEN WERE INTACT AT THE
TIME OF THE IRAQI RETREAT.
3C.                                   UPON RETURNING TO THE SITE,
AFTER OCCUPATION FORCES HAD WITHDRAWN, THE IRAQIS
DISCOVERED THAT BUNKER 73 HAD BEEN DESTROYED.  THE IRAQI
REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF WIRE AND
OTHER EVIDENCE OF GROUND DESTRUCTION PRESENT.
ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS THE SAME TYPE OF EVIDENCE TO
SUPPORT THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE ROCKETS LOCATED IN THE
OPEN AREA HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY THE OCCUPYING FORCES.
3D.                                   FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDED
UNSCOM 29'S DESTRUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 700 OF THE
REMAINING ROCKETS LOCATED IN THE OPEN AREA, AS WELL AS THE
IRAQI BACKFILL OF THE BUNKER 73 AREA WITH SOIL.(FIELD
COMMENT--UNSCOM 29/CD1 CONDUCTED ITS CW DESTRUCTION
MISSION FROM 920228 TO 920324.)
3E.                               IN ADDITION TO THE BUNKER 73
AREA, THE INSPECTION TEAM ALSO EXAMINED THE `CANAL BANK'
AREA, USED BY THE IRAQIS FOR OPEN STORAGE, AND FOUND
EVIDENCE OF SAKR-18'S//GEOCOORD:  304454.1N0462587.1E//.
THE INSPECTION TEAM EXAMINED THE REMAINS OF THE TWO MOST
SOUTHERN BUNKERS OF EACH OF THE SOUTHERNMOST ROWS (NEAREST
THE NEW CANAL, INCLUDING BUNKER 73) FOR THE PRESENCE OF CW
OR SUSPECT CW MUNITIONS.  THIS WAS DONE TO VERIFY THE
IRAQI CLAIM THAT NO OTHER CW MUNITIONS WERE PRESENT AT
KHAMISIYAH.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF FURTHER CW
MUNITIONS.  THERE WAS, HOWEVER, SOME EVIDENCE OF SOME
INTERESTING `BASE EJECT', 155MM PROJECTILES WHICH WERE
EMPTY.
3F.                                    IN SUMMARY, BASED ON PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION, AS WELL AS DISCUSSION WITH IRAQI
REPRESENTATIVES, IT APPEARED THAT THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY
2,160 GB/GF FILLED 122MM SAKR-18 CW ROCKETS AT KHAMISIYAH
AT THE TIME OF THE GULF WAR.  FURTHER, THERE IS NO REASON
TO DISBELIEVE THE IRAQIS WITH RESPECT TO CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING THE DESTRUCTION OF THESE ROCKETS.



(b.1. sec. 1.5.c.)





4.                                AN-NASIRIYAH STORAGE DEPOT.  THE
PURPOSE OF THE INSPECTION OF AN-NASIRIYAH WAS TO DOCUMENT
EVENTS SURROUNDING THE RECEIPT, STORAGE, AND REMOVAL OF
APPROXIMATELY 6,000 155MM IRAQI HD MUNITIONS MOVED TO AN-
NASIRIYAH IN THE MID 910100 TIME-FRAME.   (b.1. sec. 1.5.c.)

THE INSPECTION TEAM OBSERVED THAT 12 TO 14 BUNKERS WERE IN
USE AT THIS SITE, 22 HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY COALITION
BOMBING, AND OVER 20 HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY OCCUPATION
FORCES.
(b.1. sec. 1.5.c.)

4B.                               THE INSPECTION TEAM'S DISCUSSION
WITH THE IRAQI REPRESENTATIVES CENTERED AROUND THE
DELIVERY, STORAGE, AND MOVEMENT OF HD MUNITIONS FROM AL-
MUTHANNA TO THIS SITE IN 910100, SPECIFICALLY THE
FOLLOWING--
-QAPPROXIMATELY 6,000 MUNITIONS WERE MOVED FROM AL-
MUTHANNA TO AN-NASIRIYAH BETWEEN 910110 AND 910115.
-QTHE MUNITIONS WERE PLACED IN IRAQI BUNKER NUMBER
EIGHT//GEOCOORD:  305815.9N0461015.3E//.
-QALSO IN BUNKER EIGHT THERE WERE A RELATIVELY SMALL
NUMBER OF 120MM HE MORTAR ROUNDS AND 7.9MM BALL SMALL ARMS
AMMUNITION.
-QTHE MUNITIONS WERE REMOVED FROM BUNKER EIGHT AND AN-
NASIRIYAH OVER A ONE-WEEK PERIOD AROUND 910215 AND PLACED
IN THE OPEN AREA NEAR KHAMISIYAH (TAL AL-LAHM)//GEOCOORD:
304605.3N0462276.1E//.  THE INSPECTION TEAM EXAMINED THIS
SITE AND DISCOVERED NO EVIDENCE OF REMAINING MUNITIONS OF
ANY TYPE.  THERE IS, HOWEVER, A RECENTLY CONSTRUCTED CANAL
ADJACENT TO THE DUMP SITE.
4C.                                               THE INSPECTION TEAM EXAMINED
ADDITIONAL BUNKERS IN ORDER TO CLARIFY QUESTIONS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE AN-NASIRIYAH SITE, SPECIFICALLY THE
FOLLOWING--
-QIRAQI BUNKER NUMBERS 15//GEOCOORD:
305773.0N0461015.5E// AND 19 (UNSCOM NUMBERS 99 AND 98
RESPECTIVELY).  THE INSPECTION TEAM DID NOT OBTAIN
GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES FOR BUNKER 19, DUE TO SAFETY
CONSIDERATIONS.  THESE TWO BUNKERS WERE TYPICAL IN THEIR
CONSTRUCTION AND CONTENT, SUCH AS MIXED PROJECTILES,
MORTAR ROUNDS, SMALL ARMS AMMUNITION, AND PROPELLANT.
HOWEVER, THESE TWO STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED AT 0100
HOURS, 910117, BY COALITION BOMBING.  IN ALL APPROXIMATELY
22 STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED BY AERIAL BOMBING.  BUNKER
EIGHT WAS DESTROYED BY OCCUPATION FORCES, AS EVIDENCED BY
U.S. DETONATORS, ETC., LEFT IN PLACE.  THERE WAS NO
EVIDENCE OF OTHER THAN CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS AT THESE
SITES.
4D.                                IRAQI BUNKERS 59//GEOCOORD:
305787.7N0460917.0E//, 60//GEOCOORD:
305780.2N0460923.0E//, AND 61//GEOCOORD:
305771.0N0460922.0E// (UNSCOM NUMBERS 101 TO 103).  THESE
BUNKERS WERE ALL DESTROYED BY COALITION AERIAL BOMBING.
THEY WERE BUILT AND USED FOR STORAGE OF SENSITIVE
EXPLOSIVES, I.E. DETONATION CHARGES, DETONATORS, TNT, ETC.
AS SUCH, THEY WERE EQUIPPED WITH `CHILLERS', WHICH
PROVIDED COOLED AIR TO THE INTERIOR OF THE BUNKERS' FOUR
SEPARATE STORAGE ROOMS.  THE INSPECTION TEAM EXAMINED ALL
OF THESE BUNKERS AND DISCOVERED NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING
OTHER THAN THOSE TYPES OF EXPLOSIVES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED
AS BEING STORED THERE.
4E.                                    IRAQI BUNKER 20//GEOCOORD:
305747.7N0461047.8E// (UNSCOM NUMBER 71).  THIS BUNKER WAS
TYPICAL OF THE TYPE REMAINING IN USE.  THE DOORS TO THE
STRUCTURE WERE LOCKED, HOWEVER, THE IRAQIS READILY AGREED
TO ALLOW ACCESS.  THE CONTENTS OF THE BUNKER WERE AS
FOLLOWS--
-Q120MM MORTAR ROUNDS
-Q130MM PROJECTILES
-Q155MM HE (U.S. 820000)
-QFUSES
-QPROPELLANT
-QSMALL ARMS AMMUNITION
THE PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE BUNKER WAS ESSENTIALLY A
MAIN ROOM SURROUNDED BY AN ANNULUS WITH TWIN ANTEROOMS OFF
THE ENTRANCE.  155MM AND 12MM SHELLS WERE STACKED IN THE
ANTEROOMS.  (FIELD COMMENT--THE CHIEF INSPECTOR STATED
THAT THERE APPEARED TO BE NO `RHYME OR REASON' TO IRAQI
STORAGE PROCEDURES.)
4F.                                  IRAQI BUILDING THREE//GEOCOORD:
305745.5N0460940.0E//.  THIS STRUCTURE WAS ONE OF THREE
SUCH STRUCTURES LOCATED AT THE AN-NASIRIYAH SITE.
ESSENTIALLY THESE FACILITIES WERE CONSTRUCTED OF BRICK AND
CORRUGATED TIN, AND BUILT AT-GRADE.  THE DAMAGE ASSOCIATED
WITH THESE FACILITIES WAS EXPLAINED AS OCCURRING FROM THE
BLAST WAVE FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF ADJACENT STRUCTURES.
AN EXAMINATION OF BUILDING THREE REVEALED THE FOLLOWING
CONTENTS--
-
-Q240MM CHINESE MORTAR ROUNDS
-
-Q122MM HE ROCKETS (JORDANIAN)
-
-Q155MM HIGH EXPLOSIVE ANTI-TANK, TNT,
-    AND CYCLOTRIMETHYLENE NITRAMINE (RDX)
-QOF U.S. MANUFACTURE
-
-QROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHERS (RPG)
-
-QLIGHT ANTI-TANK WEAPONS OF RUSSIAN MANUFACTURE

4G.                                    IN SUMMARY, THERE WAS NO
INDICATION THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY CW MUNITIONS STORED AT
THIS SITE.  FURTHERMORE, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE, EITHER
PHYSICAL OR AS A RESULT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH IRAQI
REPRESENTATIVES, THAT THERE WERE CW MUNITIONS STORED HERE
IN ADDITION TO THOSE 6,000 HD MUNITIONS INDICATED ABOVE.
5.                                   THE FOLLOWING IS A LISTING OF THE
