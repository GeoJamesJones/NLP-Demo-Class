<P>By Reuters</P>
<p>The Taliban will step up attacks on NATO and American troops in Afghanistan this year, Mullah Dadullah, one of the top Taliban commanders, said by satellite telephone from an undisclosed location. &#8220;They will soon come to know about the Taliban&#8217;s strength and war strategy,&#8221; said Dadullah, who has emerged as the main figure in the resurgence of the Taliban. &#8220;We will attack with such a force they will have no time to settle.&#8221;</p>
