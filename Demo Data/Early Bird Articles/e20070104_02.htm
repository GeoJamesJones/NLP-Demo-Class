<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>Issues Of Military Recruitment </P></FONT></B></P>
<P>Your Dec. 28 editorial regarding mercenaries in uniform repeats the same untruth embodied in your Dec. 26 page-one article ("Military considers recruiting foreigners") -- that the military plans to open recruiting offices overseas to recruit noncitizens. Nonsense.</P>
<P>Citizenship criteria for military service are set in law, requiring that one be a US citizen or have been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.</P>
<P>For decades, military recruiting offices have operated overseas to support US citizens living abroad, including those whose parents are affiliated with the departments of defense or state, or with American businesses operating abroad. That will continue. Nothing more.</P>
