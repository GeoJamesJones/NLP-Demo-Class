<P>Military contractor Raytheon Co. said one of its units got a contract modification worth up to $1.4 billion from the Army to provide surveillance for defense against cruise missiles. Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems will design, build, test, and train the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System, JLENS.</P>
<P>The program provides the Army with long-range surveillance radar to detect and track incoming cruise missiles to enable the military to engage air defense systems. Work on the program will be performed in Massachusetts, California, Texas, and Maryland.</P>
<P>Separately, Waltham-based Raytheon said it won a $132 million contract to provide five King Air 350 extended range, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft and one King Air 350 light-transport aircraft, to the US Air Force.</P>
