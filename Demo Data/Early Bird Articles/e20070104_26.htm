<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>Iran’s President Promises More Nuclear Fuel And A Celebration</P></FONT></B>
<P>By Nazila Fathi</P>
<p>TEHRAN, Jan. 3 &#8212; President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned Wednesday that Iran would not back down from its nuclear ambitions and said his country would soon start producing nuclear fuel on an industrial scale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Iran has the fuel cycle, and very soon we will push the button on nuclear fuel production for industrial uses,&#8221; Mr. Ahmadinejad said in a speech in the southern city of Ghotvand in Khuzestan Province, according to the ISNA news agency.</p>

<p>The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution late last month banning the trade of goods and technology that could benefit Iran&#8217;s uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missile systems. Enriched uranium can be used for making nuclear weapons or as fuel for nuclear plants.</p>

<p>The resolution gave Iran a two-month deadline to suspend its enrichment program, but Iran says that it has the right to enrich uranium as a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Iranian people will not retreat one iota from their rights,&#8221; Mr. Ahmadinejad vowed Wednesday, adding that Iran would celebrate its nuclear achievements in February, on the 28th anniversary of the victory of the Iranian revolution of 1979.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Iranian people have made their decision to continue this path wisely and will not pay attention to empty cries of the materialists and the bullying of the decadent powers,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Other senior officials have also warned that Iran would not surrender in the face of pressure.</p>

<p>Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, an influential cleric and head of the Expediency Council, warned last week that pressing Iran could have consequences.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a very dangerous resolution,&#8221; he said during Friday Prayer at Tehran University. &#8220;They are creating problems for themselves and the region,&#8221; he said, adding that &#8220;many will suffer from the smoke of this fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>One former nuclear negotiator for Iran, Hossein Moussavian, warned the nation&#8217;s current negotiators on Wednesday that ignoring the resolution and calling it illegal would not help. He said the resolution could have severe consequences for Iran, ISNA reported. &#8220;We can say inside the country that this resolution is illegal, but we have to have a correct understanding of the international community&#8217;s considerations,&#8221; he was quoted as saying.</p>
