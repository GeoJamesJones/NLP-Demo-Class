<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>Funding The Iraq War On The QT</P></FONT></B>
<P>By Gordon Adams</P>
<P>The war in Iraq is not cheap: weekly spending of about $2 billion; monthly spending of about $8 billion, and going up, according to estimates. Overall, the war will easily end up costing $1 trillion, and maybe substantially more if President Bush decides to "surge" the forces this year.</P>
<P>The Pentagon received an "emergency" $70 billion for Iraq and anti-terrorist operations in October. Come February, the Bush administration is going to say it needs another $100 billion for this year alone.</P>
<P>In truth, we can't be sure of any of these numbers, since the Pentagon says it cannot tell us what the war has already cost, will not tell us what it might cost in the future and has ignored congressional requests and legislation asking for honest budgets, transparent reports on spending and projections of future costs.</P>
<P>Senators and representatives have had to rely on their own estimates to get some sense of the costs for the war. The Congressional Research Service estimates that Iraq has already cost about $380 billion, before the next "emergency" request, but confesses that in the absence of data from the Pentagon, it cannot be sure this is correct.</P>
<P>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Iraq could cost another $400 billion or so between now and 2015, but it points out that this is the CBO's number, not the Pentagon's, and it depends on arbitrary projections of how many American forces will stay in Iraq. Previous CBO projections for the war have all been below actual costs.</P>
<P>The Pentagon's method for Iraq budgeting makes it impossible to calculate the true cost of the war:</P>
<P>*The Pentagon doesn't ask Congress for money for Iraq; it asks for money for the global war on terrorism, or GWOT, without sorting out what belongs to Iraq, what to Afghanistan and what to other operations. Congress has already provided more than $500 billion for the GWOT, roughly 75 percent of it for Iraq.</P>
<P>*The Pentagon doesn't provide details on what the funds will be spent on. Instead, it asks for lump sums for things like "operations and maintenance, Army," and hopes to be trusted that those funds will go toward Iraq and not some other operation.</P>
<P>*The Pentagon sends up the GWOT budget as an "emergency," which means it hasn't been through the tough scrutiny of its own budget offices.</P>
<P>*The Pentagon has asked for things that aren't emergencies, like helicopters and aircraft and funds to transform Army divisions into separate operating brigades. These belong in the regular budget, but the Iraq emergency is a handy way to buy things that wouldn't fit in the regular budget.</P>
<P>"Emergency" requests escape the scrutiny of the congressional budget and armed services committees, and go straight to the appropriators--the ones who vote the money--with very little time for them to take a close look at the details.</P>
<P>*Once the Pentagon has the money, it does not report back to Congress on how the money has actually been spent. Repeated legislation requiring such reporting has been rebuffed with the argument that one cannot sort out Iraq from everything else.</P>
<P>It is not a pretty picture for taxpayers interested in honest, transparent budgeting and spending.</P>
<P>There have been a few efforts to do something about it. Republican Sens. John McCain and Judd Gregg got an amendment through last fall that required the Pentagon to put the Iraq budget into the regular budget request. Doing so would have obliged the Pentagon to scrub the request more fully, and would have let more congressional committees take a look. No deal, the White House said when it signed the defense bill.</P>
<P>James Baker III and Lee Hamilton and the Iraq Study Group called on President Bush to include Iraq war costs in the budget he will send up in February. There is no indication the president will comply.</P>
<P>The new congressional budget committee chairs--Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Rep. John Spratt (D-S.C.) joined Gregg in late December, asking Bush to bring a full and transparent Iraq budget to the Congress, along with an estimate of likely future costs. No response from the White House.</P>
<P>Budgets seem like a technical thing to focus on, when the Iraq issue is so big. But without one, there would be no war in Iraq. And budgets, along with regular reporting on spending, tell Congress and the public what is really going on, because they show where the money is going.</P>
<P>At the very least, the administration owes the public greater accountability for Iraq spending. At the most, it may be time for Congress to revive the "Truman Commission" process--a congressionally chartered and directed investigation of war spending so taxpayers will know what they have been getting, and not getting, for their money.</P>
