<P>By William M. Welch, USA TODAY</P>
<P>As the toll in Iraq passes 3,000 U.S. troop deaths, Americans are holding vigils and ceremonies to mark the grim milestone, honor the fallen and plead for an end to the war.</P>
<P>"Our slogan is, 'Yes to the troops, no to the war,' " says Chuck Fager, organizer of one vigil near Fort Bragg in North Carolina.</P>
<P>The small gathering Wednesday afternoon at a traffic circle in Fayetteville, near the home of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, was one of several this week across the country.</P>
<P>Nancy Lessin of Military Families Speak Out, an organization of military family members, says more than 200 commemorations were using the start of the new year to renew their call for an end to the war.</P>
<P>"The best way to honor those that have died is to make sure no more die," Lessin says.</P>
<P>In Fayetteville, the names of all U.S. troops killed in Iraq were tape-recorded by volunteers to be played during the vigil. In Charleston, W.Va., a muted gong was being sounded 3,000 times at a vigil outside the Robert C. Byrd Courthouse. In Boston, protesters carrying candles and pictures of the 45 Massachusetts servicemembers who have been killed and greeted commuters at the Park Street subway station Tuesday evening.</P>
<P>In Trenton, N.J., a small group of demonstrators assembled Wednesday afternoon outside the Statehouse, where the names of 52 military members from the state who died in Iraq were read and a bell was rung in their honor. Other ceremonies over the past week marked the milestone in Chicago and Kansas City.</P>
<P>Anne Chay, an Andover, Mass., high school teacher whose 19-year-old son has been in Baghdad with the Army since July, spoke at the Boston protest and again Wednesday night in Andover. This was her son's first Christmas away from home.</P>
<P>She described hearing a knock at the door in the night, fearing it could bring the message no mother wants to hear. She also voiced her feeling that the presence of U.S. troops was serving no good purpose.</P>
<P>"We don't appear to be welcome there," she said. "Hearing it firsthand from your son &#8230; it's just very discouraging.</P>
<P>Lessin, whose stepson has returned from Iraq with the Marines, says the change in control of Congress gives a new opportunity to press for an end to the war.</P>
<P>While the focus was on opponents of the war, other groups have gathered to demonstrate support for both the troops and the war.</P>
<P>Operation Support Our Troops held a candlelight vigil Christmas night outside Fort Lewis, Wash. Organizer Nadine Gulit, of Issaquah, Wash., whose three grandsons served in Iraq and Afghanistan, says she was saddened by the anti-war protests. "The message that these protesters are sending to the kids is not what they need to hear," she says.</P>
<P>"The troops need to hear the positive, that the American people stand behind them, that they are not losing their lives in vain," Gulit says.</P>
