<P>As our reservists and National Guard members continue to bravely answer the call to serve our country, we must do all we can to meet the calls of help from those families left behind who are struggling financially as a result of their loved ones' wartime service.</P>
<P>All too often, the families of reservists and National Guard members must contend not only with the physical absence of a loved one but also with the loss of income that makes meeting house payments, car insurance, medical and other bills too great of a burden to bear without help. Some 55 percent of married Guard members and reservists have experienced a loss in income, with nearly 50 percent experiencing a loss of $1,000 in pay per month and 15 percent experiencing a loss of $30,000 or more in pay a year. With our Guard and reservists putting their lives on the line, they should not also have toput their families' financial lives on the line due to their service.</P>
<P>In an effort to provide relief to these families, I will be introducing legislation at the beginning of the year that will seek to augment the limited financial assistance available to these service members' families. More specifically, the Voluntary Support for Reservists and National Guard Members Act would provide taxpayers the option of contributing part of their tax refund to an income support fund that will help those families who have experienced an income loss due to a call-up to active duty. In 2005, the IRS issued 106 million refunds that totaled $227 billion with the average refund coming in at $2,141.36. Even a small percentage of this amount could make a significant difference in the lives of these reservist and National Guard families.</P>
<P>While we can do little to ease the heartache, fears and anxieties experienced by families concerning the service of their loved ones, we can at least try to give them some peace of mind when it comes to their day-to-day finances. These families already have made a great sacrifice to the nation, and they should not also have to sacrifice their financial well-being due to their loved ones' service. Beyond our gratitude, care packages and gifts,we can thank our troops for their service by helping to meet the everyday needs of their families who are facing financial hardships. My proposal will provide Americans a convenient way to thank our troops by contributing a portion of their tax refunds to give much-needed help to the loved ones of our reservists and National Guard.</P>
