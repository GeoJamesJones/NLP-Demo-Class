<P>Defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. said it expected to expand its ballistic missile defense business overseas as regions such as Asia face growing missile threats from North Korea and other hostile states. Lockheed officials said several countries had expressed interest in buying the latest version of the Patriot missile that could be used to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles. One customer is Japan, which asked the United States this fall to speed up deployment of Patriot missile batteries. The Bethesda, Md., company has more than 10,000 employees in the Philadelphia area. -<b>- AP</b></P>
