<P>By Eugene Robinson</P>
<P>An unusual number of the people wandering through the tunnels that crisscross Capitol Hill on Wednesday had no earthly idea where they were going. "I think the Rayburn building is this way," one young woman announced to a colleague, as the two of them -- newly minted congressional staff members, I guessed -- strode away down a long corridor. I knew I'd run into them again, and soon, since actually they were just <i>leaving</i> the Rayburn building.</P>
<P>Wednesday was the last day of the "Where am I?" phase of the transition from Republican to Democratic rule on the Hill. Yesterday, with the swearing-in of new members of Congress, began the "Here we are, and now what?" phase, which means things are about to get interesting.</P>
<P>Much history already has been made, starting with the election of Nancy Pelosi as the first female speaker of the House. Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, an African American, will serve as majority whip. The first Muslim congressman, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, took his ceremonial oath of office with his hand on a Koran once owned by Thomas Jefferson. Powerful House committees such as Ways and Means, Judiciary, and Intelligence will be led by minorities.</P>
<P>The Senate still looks like an exclusive country club that grudgingly decided to let in a few women and the occasional black guy, but the House looks a lot more like the complicated, diverse country its members are supposed to represent.</P>
<P>With all due respect to the chamber that calls itself the "world's greatest deliberative body," I wouldn't expect much initiative from the new Senate -- the Democrats' one-vote majority isn't enough to get much of anything done, especially with several senators moonlighting as presidential hopefuls. The action is in the House. And that's where the "interesting" part comes in. Pelosi's plan for a blitzkrieg of legislation in the first 100 hours of the new Congress is fine -- most Americans are in favor of a higher minimum wage, expanded stem-cell research, wider availability of student loans and fewer lobbyist-paid golfing trips to Scotland for our elected representatives. Pelosi could toss in a couple of bills supporting motherhood and apple pie while she's at it.</P>
<P>That's not to belittle the Democratic agenda, as far as it goes. But it tiptoes around the big, ugly monster of an issue sitting in the middle of the room -- the war in Iraq. The new Congress is going to have to stop temporizing and stand up to George W. Bush on the war.</P>
<P>"It's time to set aside politics and focus on the future," the president said Wednesday, dusting off the familiar call for bipartisanship that always comes from the losing side in an election. In the current context, it's really a threat to paint congressional pushback on Iraq as electoral gamesmanship. But the nation has made abundantly clear what it thinks of this tragic war. Challenging the president on Iraq isn't partisan politics, it's the new Democratic majority's patriotic and constitutional duty.</P>
<P>So far, we've heard promises that the new Congress will exercise vigorous oversight -- which Congress should have been doing all along. I can understand that Pelosi and her counterpart on the Senate side, Majority Leader Harry Reid, wouldn't want to start by making the ultimate threat: using the power of the purse to cut off funding for the war. But sooner or later, there's going to have to be a confrontation.</P>
<P>Not once has Bush given the slightest indication that he intends any significant change of course in Iraq. Quite the contrary: The expectation in Washington is that soon he will announce an escalation of the war -- increasing troop levels but calling the increase a "surge" and giving the impression that it's a short-term measure. Don't be fooled by the focus-group word "surge," because a two- or three-month increase in troop levels makes no military sense. If and when the president sends more troops to Iraq, they will not soon come home.</P>
<P>Given that the Democratic Party's fortunes keep rising as Bush sinks deeper into the Iraq quagmire, political expediency might tempt the new leadership in Congress to let the president have his way and reap the rewards in 2008. But that would be wrong. Democrats can't give speeches saying that sending more troops to Iraq without a viable mission is nothing more than a futile sacrifice of young American lives -- and then limit their dispute with Bush to whether he gets to send 3,000 more troops or 30,000.</P>
<P>Very soon, perhaps inconveniently soon, Democrats are going to have to take a stand.</P>
