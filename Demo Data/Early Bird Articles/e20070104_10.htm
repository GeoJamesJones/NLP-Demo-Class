<p>BAGHDAD - The taunts and insults hurled at Saddam Hussein minutes before his execution Saturday have prompted some U.S. officials and Iraqi politicians to conclude that Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki's government is led by Shiite Muslim radicals and can't be counted on to disarm Shiite militias.</p>

<p>Several U.S. officials in Baghdad and Washington told McClatchy News Service that, practically speaking, the Bush administration no longer can expect Maliki to tackle the militias because Hussein's hanging exposed the depth of the government's sectarianism.</p>

<p>The scene at the execution ''confirms everyone's worst speculations about the government: It is sectarian and incompetent,'' said a U.S. official who agreed to speak under a promise of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic. The militias and Maliki's government are intertwined ''so much that you don't know for sure from issue to issue what is the militia and what is the government,'' the official said.</p>

<p>That assessment underscores the Bush administration's challenge as it considers sending thousands of additional U.S. troops to confront Iraq's growing sectarian violence.</p>

<p>Still, the Iraqi government on Wednesday concluded that the guards presiding over Hussein's hanging had been infiltrated by outsiders and announced the arrests of two of them and an official who supervised the hanging, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.</p>

<p>President Bush, who is expected to announce a new Iraq policy next week, has vowed to support Maliki, who came to power via U.S.-sponsored elections. He's pushing Maliki to disarm the militias, especially the Mahdi Army of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al Sadr. Many blame the Mahdi Army, which fought two bloody campaigns against U.S. forces in 2004, for much of the violence that's engulfing Baghdad.</p>

<p>The jerky cellphone video of Hussein's execution, some maintain, showed that Sadr supporters were involved. Amid Shiite chants, at least one witness to the execution can be heard chanting ``Muqtada, Muqtada, Muqtada.''</p>

<p>Someone also can be heard yelling the name of Sadr's uncle, Mohammed Baqir al Sadr, who's considered the intellectual behind Maliki's Dawa Party.</p>

<p>Sadr's father, the Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Mohammed Sadeq al Sadr, was a prominent Hussein opponent who was murdered in 1999, reportedly on Hussein's orders.</p>

<p>Some accounts of the execution indicate that Maliki's national security advisor, Mowafek al Rubaie, quizzed Hussein about the Sadr murder before Hussein, who was a Sunni Muslim, was hanged.</p>

<p>An official videotape of the execution didn't include audio.</p>

<p>Mithal Alusi, a secular parliament member who took part in the government's deliberations about Hussein's execution, said the video made it clear that the Maliki government was harboring militia members whom it didn't control. He called the display of emotions a warning that the government must cut its connections to the militias.</p>

<p>''What happened was a clear and lasting warning to Maliki to rid the security services of militias,'' said Alusi, one of a handful of secular politicians in the government.</p>
