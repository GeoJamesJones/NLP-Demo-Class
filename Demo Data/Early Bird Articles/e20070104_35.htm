<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>U.S. Must Resist 'Military Surge' And Push For 'Diplomatic Surge'</P></FONT></B>
<P>By Lawrence Korb and Brian Katulis</P>
<p>The new-look U.S. Congress is open for business as of today. And as 2007 opens, both President Bush and the Congress face critical choices about the grave and deteriorating situation in Iraq. If they do not make the right choices, this country's national security will suffer for decades, and many more Americans will die needlessly.</p>

<p>For his part, the president must ignore the advice of those inside and outside government arguing for further military escalation in Iraq - not only because it is the wrong strategy, but also because most of those urging the "military surge" option are the same people who got this country into this quagmire in the first place. Among other things, these pundits assured Bush that the war would be a cakewalk; that we would be greeted as liberators; that we could rebuild Iraq at a cost of $1.5 billion; and that we could reduce our troop strength to 30,000 by the end of 2003.</p>

<p>Rather than surging militarily for the third time in a year, the president should surge diplomatically. A further military escalation would simply mean repeating a failed strategy. In the last six months, the United States has surged twice in Baghdad - and yet the violence and death of Americans and Iraqis has increased dramatically. An additional surge would only create more targets, put more American lives at risk, increase Iraqi dependence on the United States, and further undermine the precarious readiness of our ground forces.</p>

<p>Rather than escalating, the president must redeploy all American troops from Iraq over the next 18 months. This is the only leverage the United States has left to get the Iraqis to make the painful political compromises necessary to begin the reconciliation process. These compromises involve balancing the roles of central and provincial governments; distribution of oil revenues; and protecting minority rights. Until that process is completed, the United States could put a soldier or Marine on every street corner in Baghdad without making a difference.</p>

<p>A diplomatic surge would involve appointing an individual with the stature of a former secretary of state, such as Colin Powell or Madeleine Albright, as a special envoy. This person would be charged with getting all six of Iraq's neighbors - Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait - involved more constructively in stabilizing Iraq. These countries are already involved in a bilateral, self-interested and disorganized way.</p>

<p>While their interests and ours are not identical, none of these countries wants to live with an Iraq that, after our redeployment, becomes a failed state or a humanitarian catastrophe that could become a haven for terrorists or a hemorrhage of millions more refugees streaming into their countries.</p>

<p>The high-profile envoy would also address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the role of Hezbollah and Syria in Lebanon, and Iran's rising influence in the region. The aim would not be necessarily to solve these problems, but to prevent them from getting worse and to show the Arab and Muslim world that we share their concerns about the problems in this region.</p>

<p>For its part, the new Congress must take a greater role in shaping our Iraq policy. Although our representatives and senators must provide funding for the troops already in Iraq, they also can amend the $100 billion supplemental request the administration is expected to submit soon. Such amendments could cap the number of troops in Iraq at 150,000 and prevent the administration from mobilizing National Guard and Reserve units for more than two years, even if they are not consecutive.</p>

<p>If the administration wishes to send more troops to Iraq or remobilize Guard and Reserves Units, it must submit a plan justifying that move and request an up or down vote.</p>

<p>One more U.S. military escalation in Iraq holds little hope for stabilizing the country, risks doing permanent damage to U.S. ground forces, and would undermine U.S. efforts to defeat the global terrorist networks that attacked us on 9/11. Choosing this course - as opposed to a diplomatic surge - would be, to echo Sen. Gordon Smith (R., Ore.), "absurd" and maybe even "criminal." The only responsible path forward is a new, forceful strategy that marshals the right assets for the challenges the United States faces in Iraq, in the Middle East, and around the world.</p>
